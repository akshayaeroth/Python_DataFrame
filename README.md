###python data frame

This is my first repository which include my google collab file to work with data frames in Python.
We know data frame is the most common way of storing data.The Pandas DataFrame is a structure that contains two-dimensional data and its corresponding labels.
DataFrames are widely used in data science, machine learning, scientific computing, and many other data-intensive fields.
You can think of a DataFrame like a spreadsheet, a SQL table, or a dictionary of series objects.
