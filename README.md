This Colab notebook explores the fundamentals of data frames in Python, a core data structure for data analysis and manipulation.Â 
This notebook documents my learning journey with data frames. I've explored key concepts such as:

1. Creating Data Frames 
    * From lists
    * From dictionaries
    * Reading from CSV files
2. Data Frame Operations
    * Indexing and selecting data
    * Filtering rows
    * Viewing data frame information 
3. Data Cleaning and Transformation
    * Handling missing values
    * Data type conversions
